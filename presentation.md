---

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: DockerizedApp-Deployment
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate containerized application deployment
- **Key Technologies**:
  - Docker & Docker Compose
  - Node.js
  - Express.js

---

## Project Architecture

### Container Infrastructure
```
├── Dockerfile           # Application container definition
├── docker-compose.yml   # Multi-container orchestration
├── server.js           # Node.js/Express application
└── script.sh           # Automated deployment script
```

### Key Components
1. Node.js/Express Application Server
2. Docker Container Runtime
3. Docker Compose Configuration
4. Environment Configuration

---

## Deployment Options

### 1. Automated VM Deployment
- Run automated setup script (`script.sh`)
- Handles Docker installation
- Manages repository
- Configures firewall
- Sets up application

### 2. Local Development Flow
- Build images locally
- Push to container registry
- Pull and run on VM

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated builds
- Container registry integration
- Orchestrated deployment

---

## Key Features

### Container Configuration
- Multi-stage builds
- Environment variables
- Volume mounts
- Network configuration

### Process Management
- Auto-restart capability
- Load balancing
- Application monitoring

### Security Considerations
- Automated firewall configuration (UFW)
- SSH access preservation
- Port-specific access control
- Container isolation

   - Service scaling

3. Deployment Steps
   ```bash
   # Get and run automated setup script
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HumaGitGud/DockerizedApp-Deployment/main/script.sh
   chmod +x script.sh
   ./script.sh

   # Or verify deployment
   docker compose ps
   docker compose logs
   ```
